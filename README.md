# MMOGame

It was supposed to be a game to play with friends, but while working on this game I understood how the process of creating such a project really looks like. 
I will not continue to work on it, but maybe someone will find a piece of code that will be useful :)

Basic MMO 2D game 

Server/communication - Sockets
Client GUI - Tkinter
Main game - Pygame

Works:
# log in and register system
# Character creation system ( based on 4 questions, automatically  chose one class from 34 overall
# multiply players connected at the same time 
# Saving and loading information from server real-time ( pickle-based)
# Enemy follow player in his field of view, if there are few players, enemy will follow the first one that was seen
# Lvl-scaling working 
# Quick use menu on the bottom for skills (1-9) working
# Skills Menu(v) working
# Movement system
# Collisions
# Camera following the player
# Portal to next map
